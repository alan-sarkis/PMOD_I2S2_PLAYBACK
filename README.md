# PMOD_I2S2_PLAYBACK

This code was tested on a ZYBO Z7-20 in which it functioned perfectly. The sample rate was 44.1 KHz and the main focus of this project was to just get a functioning I2S transciever. My main goal is to now implement a functioning FIR filter for the audio and output the filtered audio.

If someone is trying to use this code, make sure to setup the clock wizard accordingly and look at the reference manual for the PMOD I2S2 to get a grasp of how to setup your constraint files.
